# Far Out Fairway

#### Introduction
<p>Far Out Fairway is a 9-hole golf game prototype that was developed by a 4-person team as a submission for our Game Development final project. The team was composed of myself, Michael Barto, Matt Baldridge, and Jake Zappo. All four developers were active in all phases of development.</p>

#### Background
The Game Development course at West Chester University serves as a "large-scale systems" course in the computer science cirriculum, and our professor, Dr. Richard Burns, tasked us with designing and implementing a game prototype that meets the standards of "large-scale" with little to no direction on what game to design or how to meet that requirement, which provided an engaging, self-guided development process. While this prototype *was* created for a class project, every team created their own unique product.

#### Design
Part of the project requirements was the development of a Game Design Document, and our team modeled the Far Out Fairway design document off of the document created for Race'n'Chase, the original prototype that would later become the first Grand Theft Auto game. This document served as an opportunity to lock in on decision about aspects like art style and the game's setting before implementing the prototype.

#### Implementation
Far Out Fairway was developed using the Unity Engine, and our contributions to the code base were all written in C#. We first focused on creating the scripts that formed the basic functionality required to complete a single hole of golf, including camera movement, calculating shot power, and creating the different physics profiles for each of the three unique club types. 

These functionalities were written and tested in a simple sandbox level and after their development, some of the team began developing the levels for the final submission. These levels were created in three different worlds: a normal golf course, a desk in an office, and a space environment. This allowed the team to explore environment impacts that were uniquie to their world including water hazards, irregular obsticles, and low gravity.

During level development, I personally continued to add to the code base, writing the logic for scoring and level progression as well as adding new UI components like a scoreboard, user controls, and a birds-eye-view map for each of the levels. I also contributed to fine tuning each of the levels during their testing.
